# Cryptocurrencies - Project Overview
The goal of this project was to use unsupervised machine learning to understand how to group cryptocurrencies available in the market in order to create investment portfolios. Given the large number of options and unknown outcomes, unsupervised machine learing was used for this analysis. Kmeans and Elbow Curves were used to help identify ideal clustering values of the fitted data.
